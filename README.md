# Food mate

Food mate is calorie tracker app for Android to know how many calories and macronutrients are ingested each day.
Each food eaten can be added manually or using the barcode scanner integrated with the app. Once a new food is added,
it will be stored locally if it needs to be added more times.

## Behind the scenes

This app was made using the Clean Code Architecture (MVP) and I used Java but I would like to port it Kotlin eventually.
It was made for the subject Programaci√≥n en Entornos Multidispositivos.
